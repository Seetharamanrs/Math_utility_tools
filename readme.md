# 🧮 Math Utility Toolkit

A Python-based console application that brings together three major mathematical tools using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

- 🔢 Calculator (basic operations, factorial, square root, etc.)
- 📐 Geometry Helper (area & perimeter for shapes)
- 📊 Statistics Toolkit (mean, median, mode, range)
- 🧮 Quadratic Equation Solver
- 📐 Geometric series,Arithmetic series, Fibonacci series
- 🌐 Streamlit-based GUI for interactive use
